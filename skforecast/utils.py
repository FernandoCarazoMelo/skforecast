    '''
    
    Split indices of a time series into multiple train-test pairs. The order of
    is maintained and the training set increases in each iteration.
    
    Parameters
    ----------        
    y : 1D np.ndarray, pd.Series
        Training time series values. 
    
    initial_train_size: int 
        Number of samples in the initial train split.
        
    steps : int
        Number of steps to predict.
        
    allow_incomplete_fold : bool, default `True`
        The last test set is allowed to be incomplete if it does not reach `steps`
        observations. Otherwise, the latest observations are discarded.

    Yields
    ------
    train : 1D np.ndarray
        Training indices.
        
    test : 1D np.ndarray
        Test indices.
