    "In time series forecasting, evaluating the performance of predictive models is crucial to ensure accurate and reliable forecasts. Forecasting metrics are quantitative measures used to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of these models. They help in comparing different models, diagnosing errors, and making informed decisions based on forecast results. This document outlines some of the most commonly used metrics in time series forecasting, including their equations, advantages, and disadvantages."
