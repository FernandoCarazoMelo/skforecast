## Introduction


A time series is a sequence of data arranged chronologically, in principle, equally spaced in time. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values, with the option of also including other external variables.

When working with time series, it is seldom needed to predict only the next element in the series $`(t+1)`$. Instead, the most common goal is to predict a whole future interval $`(t+1, ..., t+n`$  or a far point in time $`t+n`$ .

Since the value of $`t + 1`$ is required to predict the point $`t + 2`$, and $`t + 1`$ is unknown, it is necessary to make recursive predictions in which, each new prediction , is based on the previous one. This process is known as recursive forecasting or multi-step forecasting and it is the main difference with respect to conventional regression problems.

The main challenge when using scikit learn models for forecasting is transforming the time series in an matrix where, each value of the series, is related to the time window (lags) that precede it.

**Skforecast** is a python library that eases using scikit-learn regressors as multi-step forecasters.
